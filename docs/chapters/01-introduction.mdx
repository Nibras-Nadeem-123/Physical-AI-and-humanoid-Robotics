# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This chapter provides an overview of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, setting the stage for the rest of the textbook. It covers fundamental concepts, the importance of this field, and what readers can expect to learn.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the real world through physical bodies, sensors, and actuators. Unlike purely software-based AI, physical AI embodies intelligence in a tangible form, allowing it to perform tasks in dynamic and unstructured environments.

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are a key application area of Physical AI. These robots are designed to resemble the human body, often with two arms, two legs, and a torso. Their human-like form factor allows them to operate in environments designed for humans, performing complex manipulation and locomotion tasks.

## Why Study Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics?

The convergence of AI and robotics is poised to revolutionize various industries, from manufacturing and healthcare to logistics and exploration. Understanding the principles and technologies behind physical AI and humanoid robotics is crucial for aspiring engineers, researchers, and innovators.
