# Chapter 10: Robotics Hardware - From Sensors to Actuators

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the essential hardware components that constitute modern robots. We will explore various types of sensors for perceiving the environment, different categories of actuators for generating motion, and the embedded computing platforms that serve as the brains of these physical AI systems.

## Sensors: Perceiving the World

Robots rely on an array of sensors to gather information about their internal state and the external environment. Key sensor types include:

*   **Vision Sensors (Cameras)**: Monocular, stereo, and depth cameras (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) for object detection, recognition, and 3D reconstruction.
*   **LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: Scanners that use pulsed laser light to measure distances to targets, crucial for mapping and navigation.
*   **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)**: Combinations of accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration, essential for robot localization and stabilization.
*   **Force/Torque Sensors**: Used in robot arms and grippers to measure interaction forces, enabling compliant manipulation.
*   **Proximity Sensors**: Ultrasonic, infrared, and time-of-flight sensors for short-range obstacle detection.
*   **Encoders**: Measure the angular position or displacement of motors and joints, providing proprioceptive feedback.

## Actuators: Bringing Robots to Life

Actuators are the components responsible for converting energy into physical motion. Common types in robotics include:

*   **Electric Motors**: DC motors (brushed, brushless), servo motors, and stepper motors are widely used for their precision, control, and efficiency.
*   **Hydraulic Actuators**: Provide high force and power density, often used in heavy-duty industrial robots or large-scale humanoids.
*   **Pneumatic Actuators**: Utilize compressed air for fast, high-force applications, though often less precise than electric or hydraulic systems.
*   **Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs)**: Integrate a spring element in series with a motor to provide compliance, shock absorption, and accurate force control, crucial for safe human-robot interaction.
*   **Manipulators and Grippers**: End-effectors designed for grasping, holding, and manipulating objects.

## Embedded Computing Platforms

The brain of a physical AI system is typically an embedded computing platform, chosen based on computational needs, power constraints, and real-time requirements:

*   **Microcontrollers (MCUs)**: Low-power, low-cost devices (e.g., Arduino, ESP32) for simple control tasks and sensor interfacing.
*   **Single Board Computers (SBCs)**: More powerful than MCUs, offering full operating systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson) for complex algorithms, AI inference, and ROS 2 integration.
*   **FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)**: Customizable hardware for high-speed, parallel processing, often used for real-time sensor fusion or low-latency control loops.
*   **GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)**: Essential for accelerating AI workloads, deep learning inference, and complex simulations, often found in high-performance robotics platforms.

## Power Systems and Communication

*   **Batteries**: Lithium-ion (Li-ion) and Lithium Polymer (LiPo) are common for mobile robots due to their high energy density.
*   **Power Management Units (PMUs)**: Regulate and distribute power to various robot components.
*   **Communication Protocols**: Wired (Ethernet, USB, CAN bus, I2C, SPI) and wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee) protocols for inter-component and external communication.

## Integration and System Design

Designing a robotic system involves carefully selecting and integrating these hardware components, considering factors such as:

*   **Weight and Size**: Impact on mobility, payload, and energy consumption.
*   **Power Budget**: Matching power supply with component demands.
*   **Computational Load**: Ensuring the chosen computing platform can handle the required algorithms.
*   **Modularity**: Designing for easy upgradeability and maintenance.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: Balancing performance with budget constraints.
