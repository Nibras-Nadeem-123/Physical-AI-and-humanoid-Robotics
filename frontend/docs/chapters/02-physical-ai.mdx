# Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Physical AI

This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding Physical AI. We move beyond theoretical AI to explore the challenges and opportunities of creating intelligent agents that operate in the real world.

## 2.1 The Embodiment Hypothesis

Embodiment posits that an agent's body (its physical form and sensory-motor capacities) plays a central role in shaping its intelligence. We will discuss how the physical structure of a robot influences its perception, learning, and interaction with the world.

## 2.2 The Perception-Action Loop

A cornerstone of physical AI is the continuous cycle of perceiving the environment, reasoning about it, and taking action. This section breaks down the components of the perception-action loop:
- **Sensing:** Acquiring data from the environment through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, etc.).
- **Perception:** Interpreting sensor data to build a meaningful model of the world.
- **Planning:** Deciding on a course of action to achieve a goal.
- **Control:** Executing the plan by sending commands to actuators (motors).

## 2.3 State Estimation, Localization, and Mapping

For a robot to act effectively, it must know where it is and what its state is. This section introduces key algorithms for:
- **State Estimation:** Determining the robot's configuration (e.g., joint angles, velocity).
- **Localization:** Identifying the robot's position and orientation within its environment.
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** The process of building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of the agent's location within it.

## 2.4 Introduction to Machine Learning for Robotics

Machine learning has revolutionized robotics. We will provide an overview of the primary ML paradigms used in physical AI:
- **Supervised Learning:** Training models on labeled data for tasks like object detection.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Training agents to make optimal decisions by trial and error, based on a reward signal.
- **Imitation Learning:** Training agents by demonstrating the desired behavior.
