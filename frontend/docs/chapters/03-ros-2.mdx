# Chapter 3: Robot Operating System (ROS) 2

ROS 2 is the de facto standard framework for robotics software development. This chapter provides a deep dive into the architecture and tools of ROS 2, equipping you with the skills to build complex robotic applications.

## 3.1 From ROS 1 to ROS 2: A New Architecture

We'll explore the reasons for the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, focusing on the architectural improvements that make ROS 2 suitable for real-time, multi-robot, and commercial systems. Key changes include the adoption of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) for communication.

## 3.2 Core Concepts of ROS 2

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system:
- **Nodes:** The primary computational units.
- **Topics:** Buses for asynchronous, anonymous data streams (Publish/Subscribe).
- **Services:** For synchronous, request/reply interactions.
- **Actions:** For long-running, feedback-enabled tasks.
- **Parameters:** For configuring nodes at runtime.
- **Launch Files:** For starting and configuring a system of multiple nodes.

## 3.3 Creating a ROS 2 Workspace

A hands-on guide to setting up your development environment. You will learn how to:
- Create a workspace.
- Create and build packages.
- Source the environment to make your packages available.

## 3.4 Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber

We'll walk through the process of creating your first ROS 2 nodes in both Python and C++. This practical exercise will solidify your understanding of the publish/subscribe communication pattern.

## 3.5 URDF and Robot Modeling

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is used to describe a robot's physical structure. You will learn how to create a URDF file for a simple robot, defining its links and joints, and how to visualize it in RViz2.
