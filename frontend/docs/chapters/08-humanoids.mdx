# Chapter 8: Humanoid Robot Design and Control

This chapter focuses on the unique challenges of designing and controlling humanoid robots. We move from general robotics principles to the specific problems posed by bipedal, high-degree-of-freedom systems.

## 8.1 Humanoid Kinematics and Dynamics

We will delve into the mathematics of humanoid robots, including:
- **Forward and Inverse Kinematics:** Calculating the position of the end-effectors from joint angles and vice-versa.
- **Whole-Body Control:** Formulating control problems that involve the entire robot's body, not just its arms.
- **Center of Mass (CoM) and Zero Moment Point (ZMP):** Understanding the key concepts for maintaining balance.

## 8.2 Bipedal Locomotion: Walking and Running

Getting a humanoid to walk is a classic robotics problem. This section covers:
- **The Gait Cycle:** The sequence of movements involved in a single step.
- **Pattern Generators:** Algorithms that create the rhythmic joint trajectories for walking.
- **Stabilization:** How to use feedback from sensors like IMUs and foot pressure sensors to keep the robot from falling over.

## 8.3 Manipulation and Grasping

Humanoid robots are intended to interact with the world using their hands. We will explore:
- **Hand Design:** An overview of different types of robotic hands, from simple grippers to complex, multi-fingered hands.
- **Grasp Planning:** Algorithms for deciding how to hold an object.
- **Whole-Body Manipulation:** How to use the robot's entire body (legs, torso) to assist in manipulation tasks, just as humans do.

## 8.4 A Survey of Modern Humanoid Platforms

This section provides an overview of the most significant humanoid robots in development today, such as:
- Boston Dynamics' Atlas
- Agility Robotics' Digit
- Tesla's Optimus
- Apptronik's Apollo
- Figure AI's 01

We will discuss their design philosophies, key technologies, and intended applications.
