# Chapter 9: Capstone Project: Humanoid Teleoperation

This chapter brings together everything you have learned in the book. You will build a complete software system to control a humanoid robot in a simulated environment to perform a useful task.

## 9.1 Project Goal: Warehouse Assistant

The goal of the capstone project is to have a simulated humanoid robot act as a warehouse assistant. The robot will need to be able to:
1.  Navigate to a designated shelf.
2.  Identify and pick up a specific box.
3.  Carry the box to a delivery area.
4.  Place the box on a table.

This task requires the integration of navigation, perception, and manipulation.

## 9.2 System Architecture

We will design the system architecture using ROS 2. This will involve creating a set of interconnected nodes for:
- **Navigation:** Using the Nav2 stack to move the robot around the warehouse.
- **Perception:** Using a simulated camera and an object detection model to find the target box.
- **Manipulation:** Using MoveIt 2 to plan and execute the picking and placing motions.
- **State Machine:** A top-level node to coordinate the overall behavior of the robot.

## 9.3 Implementation Step-by-Step

This section provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to implementing the project:
1.  **Setting up the Simulation:** We'll create a warehouse environment in Isaac Sim and import a humanoid robot model.
2.  **Configuring Nav2:** You'll learn how to configure the ROS 2 Navigation stack for a bipedal robot.
3.  **Configuring MoveIt 2:** You'll create a MoveIt configuration package for the humanoid's arms.
4.  **Writing the Perception Node:** You'll write a ROS 2 node that subscribes to camera images, runs a simple object detector, and publishes the location of the target box.
5.  **Writing the Main Control Node:** You'll implement the state machine that calls the other components (Nav2, MoveIt) to execute the task.

## 9.4 Running the System

After implementing all the components, you will run the entire system using a ROS 2 launch file. You'll be able to watch your humanoid robot autonomously perform the warehouse task from start to finish. This project will serve as a powerful portfolio piece and a demonstration of your skills in humanoid robotics.
