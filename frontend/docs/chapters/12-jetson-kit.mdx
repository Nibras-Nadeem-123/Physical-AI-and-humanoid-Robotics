# Chapter 12: Getting Started with the Jetson AI Kit

This chapter provides a hands-on introduction to the NVIDIA Jetson platform, a powerful and compact series of computers designed to bring AI and deep learning to edge devices like robots.

## 12.1 What is NVIDIA Jetson?

An overview of the Jetson family (including the Jetson Nano, Orin Nano, and AGX Orin). We'll discuss why these devices are ideal for robotics, combining a powerful GPU for AI inference with a CPU for general-purpose computing and a rich set of I/O.

## 12.2 Setting up Your Jetson Developer Kit

This section is a step-by-step tutorial for getting your Jetson device ready for development:
1.  **Flashing the OS:** How to flash the NVIDIA JetPack SDK onto an SD card or the internal eMMC.
2.  **First Boot and Setup:** Initial configuration of the operating system.
3.  **Installing Essential Software:** Setting up ROS 2, and other key libraries.

## 12.3 Running Your First AI Model

The power of the Jetson lies in its GPU. You will learn how to:
- Use the pre-trained models included with the JetPack SDK for tasks like image classification and object detection.
- Run these models on a live camera feed using the `jetson-inference` library.
- Understand the performance characteristics of your Jetson device.

## 12.4 Integrating Jetson with ROS 2

This section shows you how to create a ROS 2 node that leverages the Jetson's GPU. You will write a simple perception node that:
1.  Captures images from a USB camera.
2.  Runs an object detection model on the GPU.
3.  Publishes the results (bounding boxes and class labels) to a ROS 2 topic.

This forms the basis of a real-world perception system for a robot.

## 12.5 Next Steps and Further Learning

The Jetson platform is incredibly deep. This final section provides a roadmap for your continued learning, pointing you to resources for:
- Training your own custom AI models with NVIDIA TAO.
- Optimizing model performance with TensorRT.
- Building more complex robotics projects with the Isaac ROS stack.

Congratulations on completing the foundational journey into Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
